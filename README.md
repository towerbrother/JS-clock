# JS-clock

The clock is built with **HTML**, **CSS** and **Vanilla Javascript**.

It consist of two main parts: the **clock face** and the three **hours**, **minutes** and **seconds** hands.

The `setDate()` method, called every 1 second by the `setInterval(setDate, 1000)` method, calculates the current time and the correct degree each hand shall position itself.
